# Lambda Expressions
Lambda expressions in C# are used like anonymous functions, with the difference that in Lambda expressions you donâ€™t need to specify the type of the value that you input thus making it more flexible to use.<br/> 
The `=>` is the lambda operator which is used in all lambda expressions. The Lambda expression is divided into two parts, the left side is the input and the right is the expression.
