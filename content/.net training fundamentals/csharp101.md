# C# 101

On this section you will learn the basics and good practices about C#.

****Learning objectives****

- Write your first lines of C# code
- Usage of variables
- String operators
- Store and manipulate data to modify its type and appearance
- Execute built-in functionality available from libraries of code
- Add logic to your code to enable complex business functionality

**Prerequisites**

- None

### First C# Code

[Write your first C# code - Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/csharp-write-first/)

### Use of variables

[Store and retrieve data using literal and variable values in C# - Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/csharp-literals-variables/)

### String formatting, concatenation, interpolation, varbatim strings

[Perform basic string formatting in C# - Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/csharp-basic-formatting/)

### Number operations

[Perform basic operations on numbers in C# - Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/csharp-basic-operations/)

### Usage of the .NET native class library

[Call methods from the .NET Class Library using C# - Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/csharp-call-methods/)

### Decision logic statements and Boolean expressions

[Add decision logic to your code using `if`, `else`, and `else if` statements in C# - Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/csharp-if-elseif-else/)

[Evaluate Boolean expressions to make decisions in C# - Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/csharp-evaluate-boolean-expressions/)

### Basic code conventions on C#

[Create readable code with conventions, whitespace, and comments in C# - Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/csharp-readable-code/)

### Take a breath

Now it is time to take a break. When you look back you see all the progress you have done. But, do not stop just keep learning!

Let your tutor know how far you are now.

## Letâ€™s take the level up!

### Variable scope

[Control variable scope and logic using code blocks in C# - Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/csharp-code-blocks/)

### Switch-case

[Branch the flow of code using the switch-case construct in C# - Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/csharp-switch-case/)

So, at this point, you would be wondering if C# has the capability to work with arrays and iterates it. The answer is yes and here you will see a couple of modules that explain them in detail.

### For statement

[Iterate through a code block using for statement in C# - Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/csharp-for/)

### While and do-while statements

[Add looping logic to your code using the do-while and while statements in C# - Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/csharp-do-while/)

### Use of arrays

[Store and iterate through sequences of data using Arrays and the foreach statement in C# - Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/csharp-arrays/)

If you are still here it means you completed the C# training. Now you dominate the basics of C#. It is the beginning of a long but great way waiting for us.

## **Working with data types in C#**

This section is optional for you but I will encourage you to take as you want to be an expert in the C# world.

### Value types and reference types

[Choose the correct data type in your C# code - Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/csharp-choose-data-type/)

### Casting and parsing

### Perform operations on arrays

[Perform operations on arrays using helper methods in C# - Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/csharp-arrays-operations/)

### Alphanumeric data format

[Format alphanumeric data for presentation in C# - Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/csharp-format-strings/)

### Modify string content

[Modify the content of strings using built-in string data type methods in C# - Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/csharp-modify-content/)
