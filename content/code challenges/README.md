![challengesboy](challenges-boy.png)

## Introduction

This section aims to prepare a .NET developer for the core topics of the framework. The methodology to be used here is to have a set of code challenges that with the guidance of a tutor will help the trainee to increase and accelerate the learning curve of specific topics that any .NET developer uses day by day.

On this code challenge section you can find excercises that will cover following topics.
 - C# keywords like in, out, params, nameof, etc
 - String manipulation
 - Use of collections
 - Method overload
 - File stream operation
 - and more..

 ## Code challenge structure
A code challenge exercise should be focused on one or a group of topics to teach and evaluate. It is important to mention that the idea is not to cover all the topics of the language and framework in just one single exercise.

The suggested structure of a learning code challenge is basically covering the following sections in your content.
 - Excercise enunciate
 - Related info or material (Blog links, videos, books, or suggestions). Optional
 - A list of the skills or learning objects that you will learn once complete the challenge
 - A code snippet of code link reference if needed
